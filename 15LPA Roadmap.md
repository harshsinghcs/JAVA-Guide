- Config Server
- Load Balancer (Ribbon)

**⏳ Duration:** 7–8 days  
**🎯 Task:** Build 2-3 services and connect via Eureka

---

### 🧪 Phase 4: Tools

> Day-to-day dev tools for API testing, version control, deployment

**Topics/Tools:**
- Git & GitHub (push, pull, merge, branch)
- Postman (API testing)
- Docker (Dockerfile, Images, Containers)

**⏳ Duration:** 5 days  
**🎯 Task:** Containerize Spring Boot app + test with Postman

---

### 🛢️ Phase 5: SQL & MySQL

> Database knowledge is always tested

**Topics:**
- Basic Queries (CRUD)
- JOINS: Inner, Left, Right
- GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY
- Subqueries
- Indexing, Normalization

**⏳ Duration:** 5 days  
**🎯 Practice:** MySQL Workbench or DBeaver

---

### 🚀 Phase 6: Java 8, 11 & 17 Features

> 🔍 Version-based questions are commonly asked in interviews — especially Java 8.

#### ✅ Java 8 (Most Important)
- **Lambda Expressions** → Functional style of writing code.
- **Stream API** → For processing collections using map, filter, reduce.
- **Functional Interfaces** → `@FunctionalInterface`, used in Lambdas.
- **Default & Static Methods in Interfaces** → Add method body to interfaces.
- **Optional Class** → To avoid `NullPointerException`.
- **Method References** → `ClassName::methodName`
- **Date & Time API (java.time)** → New time API replacing `Date`.

🎯 **Must Know Cold — Used in all real-world apps**

---

#### ✅ Java 11 (Popular in modern projects)
- **`var`** → Local variable type inference.
- **String Enhancements** → `isBlank()`, `lines()`, `strip()`
- **File Enhancements** → `Files.readString()`, `writeString()`
- **New HTTP Client API** → `HttpClient`, `HttpRequest`, `HttpResponse`
- **Collection to Array** → `toArray(IntFunction<T[]>)`

---

#### ✅ Java 17 (LTS – Often asked in latest interviews)
- **Sealed Classes** → Restrict which classes can extend a class.
- **Pattern Matching for instanceof** → Cleaner type casting.
- **Switch Expressions** → More powerful and concise switch syntax.
- **Text Blocks** → Multi-line strings using `"""` (introduced in Java 13, stabilized in Java 15+).

---

**⏳ Duration:** 3–4 days (Focus more on Java 8)

📌 Tip: List down real-world examples for each feature and try using them in small programs or during your mini projects.

---

### 📦 Phase 7: Apache Kafka

> Event-driven, real-time data processing

**Topics:**
- Kafka Core Concepts: Producer, Consumer, Topic
- Kafka Config (Bootstrap servers, group ID)
- Kafka with Spring Boot: KafkaTemplate, Listener

**⏳ Duration:** 3–4 days  
**🎯 Task:** Kafka-based Notification Service

---

### ☁️ Phase 8: AWS S3

> Cloud integration — highly valuable

**Topics:**
- Create/Upload/Delete from S3 Bucket
- Set Public Access
- Integrate S3 with Spring Boot

**⏳ Duration:** 2–3 days  
**🎯 Task:** File upload/download microservice

---

### 🎨 Phase 9: Angular + TypeScript (Optional)

> For full-stack roles

**Topics:**
- Angular CLI, Components, Modules
- Routing, Services, HttpClient
- Forms, Two-Way Binding
- Angular + Spring Boot Integration
- TypeScript: Types, Interfaces, Classes

**⏳ Duration:** 10 days  
**🎯 Project:** Full-Stack CRUD App

---

### 🏛️ Phase 10: System Design

> Essential for 2+ years experience roles

**Topics:**
- Basics: Scalability, Load Balancer, Caching
- Designing RESTful Systems
- HLD Examples: URL Shortener, E-Commerce, YouTube

**⏳ Duration:** 7–10 days  
**🎯 Watch:** Gaurav Sen / NeetCode System Design videos
