# **How to solve conflicts** in detail:


Great question üëç ‚Äî **Git conflicts** happen when two branches change the same part of a file, or when a branch modifies a file that was deleted in another branch. Let‚Äôs go step by step so you can understand **how to solve conflicts** in detail:

---

## üîπ When do conflicts happen?

* **Merging** two branches (`git merge feature` into `main`)
* **Pulling** changes (`git pull origin main`) when your local changes clash with remote
* **Rebasing** (`git rebase main`)
* **Cherry-picking** commits

---

## üîπ Steps to Solve Conflicts

### 1. Identify the conflict

After running a merge/rebase/pull, Git will say something like:

```
Auto-merging file.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file.txt
```

You can check conflict status:

```bash
git status
```

It will show the files with conflicts:

```
both modified:   file.txt
```

---

### 2. Open the conflicted file

Inside the file, Git marks conflict sections like this:

```text
<<<<<<< HEAD
Your changes (from current branch)
=======
Incoming changes (from the branch you're merging)
>>>>>>> feature
```

---

### 3. Resolve the conflict

You need to manually edit the file:

* Choose **your changes**
* Choose **incoming changes**
* Or **combine both**

Example resolved:

```text
Final correct content you want to keep
```

---

### 4. Mark conflict as resolved

After fixing the file(s), run:

```bash
git add file.txt
```

---

### 5. Continue the process

* If it was a **merge**:

  ```bash
  git commit
  ```
* If it was a **rebase**:

  ```bash
  git rebase --continue
  ```

---

## üîπ If you get stuck

* **Cancel merge/rebase**:

  ```bash
  git merge --abort
  git rebase --abort
  ```
* **Check differences**:

  ```bash
  git diff
  ```
* **Use a GUI tool** (in VS Code or GitHub Codespaces, conflict resolution UI helps a lot).

---

## üîπ Example Workflow (merge conflict in Codespace)

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature
git merge main
# conflict happens
# open file in editor, resolve
git add .
git commit
git push origin feature
```
