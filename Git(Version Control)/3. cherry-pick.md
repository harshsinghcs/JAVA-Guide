Great question Harsh 👍 Let’s go step by step.

## 🔹 What is `git cherry-pick`?

`git cherry-pick` is used to **pick a specific commit from one branch and apply it to another branch** without merging the whole branch.

---

## 🔹 Why do we use `cherry-pick`?

### 👉 Short Interview Answer:

We use git cherry-pick when we want to apply a specific commit from one branch to another without merging the entire branch. This is very useful for bug fixes, hotfixes, or when we accidentally commit in the wrong branch.

## Details Understand

We use it when:

1. **Bug fix in another branch**

   * Suppose you fixed a bug in `develop`, but the same fix is also needed in `main`.
     Instead of merging the whole `develop`, you can cherry-pick just that commit.

2. **Selective commit transfer**

   * You don’t want *all commits* from a branch, just *one or two important ones*.
     Example: A small feature or patch.

3. **Hotfix in production**

   * When a production bug is fixed in `main`, the same commit can be cherry-picked into `develop` so the fix isn’t lost.

4. **Avoid full merge conflicts**

   * Instead of merging large branches, you pick only the required commits, reducing conflicts.

---

## 🔹 Example

Imagine:

* You are on `main` branch
* A bug was fixed in `develop` (commit `abc123`)

To apply it on `main`:

```bash
git checkout main
git cherry-pick abc123
```

✅ Now that one commit is applied to `main`.

---

## 🔹 Difference from Merge/Rebase

* **Merge**: Brings *all changes* from another branch.
* **Rebase**: Replays commits from one branch onto another.
* **Cherry-pick**: Copies *only the selected commit(s)*.

---

⚡ In short:
👉 Use **cherry-pick** when you want **only one (or few) specific commits**, not the entire branch history.

# Real project workflow examples:-

Perfect 👍 Let’s go through **real-world project workflows** where companies actually use `git cherry-pick` so you can confidently explain this in interviews with examples 👇

---

## 🔥 **Real Project Workflows for Cherry-Pick**

### 1. **Hotfix in Production**

* Imagine your app is live on **production** (`main` branch).
* A **critical bug** is reported (like payment issue).
* You quickly fix it on a separate `hotfix` branch and merge into `main`.
* But the **same fix is also needed in `develop` (or staging)** so that it doesn’t get lost when the next release goes live.

👉 Instead of re-writing the fix, you run:

```bash
git checkout develop
git cherry-pick <commit_id_of_hotfix>
```

✅ Now the hotfix is applied to both `main` and `develop`.

---

### 2. **Backporting Fixes**

* Your company supports **multiple versions** of the product (v1.0, v2.0, v3.0).
* A bug is fixed in `v3.0`.
* Customers using `v2.0` also need the same fix.

👉 You can cherry-pick the commit from `v3.0` branch to `v2.0` branch.

---

### 3. **Selective Feature Promotion**

* You are working on a feature branch with **10 commits**.
* QA team says: *“Only commit X and Y are stable, don’t merge the rest yet.”*
* Instead of merging the entire branch, you cherry-pick only those stable commits.

👉 This is useful for **partial rollouts**.

---

### 4. **Emergency Patch Without Full Merge**

* Let’s say your `feature/xyz` branch is far behind `main`.
* You need **only one bug fix** from that branch on `main`, not all changes.

👉 Instead of merging the whole branch (which can cause conflicts), you cherry-pick that single commit.

---

## 🏢 **How Companies Actually Use It**

* **E-commerce companies (Amazon, Flipkart, Walmart)**

  * Use cherry-pick to apply **hotfixes on checkout/payment bugs** directly on `main` and later backport to development.

* **Banking/FinTech companies**

  * Use cherry-pick for **regulatory fixes** that must go live immediately while keeping development stable.

* **Open-source projects (Linux Kernel, React, Kubernetes)**

  * Use cherry-pick for **backporting fixes** to older LTS (Long-Term Support) branches.

---

👉 So, when asked in an interview *“Why do we use cherry-pick?”*
You can answer:

💡 **“We use cherry-pick when we need to apply a specific commit from one branch to another, without merging the entire branch. For example, in production hotfixes, backporting fixes to older versions, or selectively moving stable commits. This helps in keeping branches clean and avoids unnecessary merges.”**
